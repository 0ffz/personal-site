I am a software developer currently studying mathematics at the University of Toronto Scarborough. I've been leading open source projects and sysadmin work at [Mine in Abyss](https://mineinabyss.com) for the past 7 years.

My last job was at [Sensei Labs](https://www.senseilabs.com/), where I worked with a large .NET application and lots of SQL queries. You can find my personal projects in the tab above, too.

In my spare time, I've been learning the piano, messing around with my own sync engine while learning about game netcode, and playing a little too much osu!mania.
